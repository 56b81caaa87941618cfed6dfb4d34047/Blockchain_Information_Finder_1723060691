The user agreed to provide color codes and styles. The assistant then offered a list of potential additional features, confirming the inclusion of a sticky header with a logo and search bar, and a footer with quick links, legal information, and social media icons, while several other features remained unchecked. \n\nThe user repeated their request for a navbar, prompting a similar list of options, which included implementing user authentication and incorporating a search functionality, among others. The AI also inquired about the positioning of a 'Submit' button, giving the user options for its location and functionality. The user asked for a 'Submit' button, which the AI acknowledged and started incorporating.\n\nAdditionally, the user requested a button labeled \"Hello World.\" The AI confirmed their input and began working on it. The AI concluded by asking the user for more details about the project to better understand their requirements.",
